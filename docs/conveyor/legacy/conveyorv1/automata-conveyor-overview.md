# Overview

ConveyorV1 has the following components:

-  **gToken smart contract**: inherits the ERC20 contract with modified function methods that must be invoked by trusted Geode-provided addresses.

-  **Controller smart contract**: interacts with the users and facilitates the transfer of gTokens. External calls to any functions in the contract from any addresses other than the trusted relayers will be reverted.

The following is an overview of the architecture.

!!! Note
    The Geode is an on-chain computation resource provided by the Automata network.
