# 1RPC+

### Overview

1RPC+ is a subscription plan that offers users more granular, dynamic control of their interaction with blockchain. 

The waitlist for 1RPC+ is now at capacity, and we will begin to invite users over the next few weeks. 

### Features

- ### Transaction sanitizers 

    Transaction sanitizers deter both known and emerging phishing threats that precede a potential loss of funds. Anti-phishing rules help users to avoid interactions with bad actors. Address scanning warns against a network of known, malicious addresses and smart contracts. Explorer contract verification and recipient validation on exchanges such as Uniswap ensures that users are interacting with genuine, official sources. 

- ### Bespoke RPC 

     Users of 1RPC+ own and customize a unique RPC endpoint to structure their journey in Web3, instead of having to go along with a blanket protection policy. 1RPC+ provides clarity for users on how they interact with a dApp or smart contract. This offers a more intuitive experience, but also the freedom of choice to strike a balance between user convenience and privacy protection. 

- ### Fail-safe protection 

     1RPC+ users are buffered from potential phishing attempts even if its wider technical environment becomes vulnerable to such attacks. For the user on a wallet that does not offer native anti-phishing protection, 1RPC+ will still be able to detect and prevent malicious transactions from taking place in real-time, ao long as the relevant transaction sanitizer was set up in the first place. 

### Customization

- #### Usage quota
    * Rule ID: 001
    * Rule Details: There is a default daily usage quota for each 1RPC+ user, and if it reaches the limitation, 1RPC+ will stop the upcoming requests until the following day (00:00 UTC).
    * Default quota: 40,000
    * Error code: -32001
    * Error message: Exceeded the quota usage
    * Example:
    ```shell
    {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "error": {"code": -32001, "message": "Exceeded the quota usage"}, "id": 1}
    ```

- #### Address whitelist/blacklist
    * Rule ID: 002
    * Rule Details: 1RPC+ users are able to create, edit and maintain a list of addresses they trust or don't turst. 1RPC+ will encrypt and save these lists as a part of the customized configuration. For each eth_sendRawTransaction request, 1RPC+ will decode and deserialize the interactive addresses, then validate these addresses by using usersâ€™ config.
