# 1RPC+

### Overview

1RPC+ is a subscription plan that offers users more granular, dynamic control of their personal data. 

The waitlist for 1RPC+ is now at capacity, and we will begin to invite users over the next few weeks. 

### Features

- ### Anti-phishing

    Anti-phishing rules help users to avoid interactions with bad actors and allows them to explore Web3 with greater confidence. With the support of application tools from some of the best security partners in the space, including AvengerDAO and GoPlus, users are warned away from a network of known, malicious addresses and contracts that is sourced, flagged and updated regularly over time. 

- ### Transaction Sanitizers 

     Transactions often feel intimidating because of a lack of transparency. Our goal is to give users on 1RPC+ a better understanding of how a dApp or smart contract interacts with their wallet. With transaction sanitizers that can be added or edited at any time, this reduces the likelihood of users ending up in unwanted situations. 

- ### Zero-tracking 

     The same rigorous standards of privacy-protection on 1RPC applies as well on 1RPC+. For a refresher on how the relay achieves zero-tracking, read [this](./design.md).
