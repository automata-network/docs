# 1RPC+

### Overview

1RPC+ is a subscription plan that offers users more granular, dynamic control of their personal data. 

The waitlist for 1RPC+ is now at capacity, and we will begin to invite users over the next few weeks. 

### Features

- ### Anti-phishing

    Transaction sanitizers mitigate traditional and novel security risks, with one example being anti-phishing rules that help users to avoid interactions with bad actors. These can be added or edited at any point in time. 

- ### Exploit protection 

     With the support of application tools from some of the best security partners in the space, users can also rely on transaction sanitizers such as address scanning to be warned away from a network of known, malicious contracts. 

- ### Zero tracking 

     The same rigorous standards of privacy-protection on 1RPC applies as well on 1RPC+. For a refresher on how the relay achieves zero tracking, read [this](./design.md).
