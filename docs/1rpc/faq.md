# Frequently Asked Questions

### **1. What makes 1RPC different from the other RPC providers?**
    
1RPC is a proxy or relay layer shielding user data before it reaches existing RPC endpoints (most are centralized). The team behind it is [Automata](http://ata.network), whose mission is to protect privacy and fairness in Web3. We care about user privacy and does not collect any user metadata like others.
    
### **2. What wallets can I use with 1RPC?**
    
You can use it with any wallets that supports customized RPC endpoints. The most popular one is MetaMask. We are also working on partnering with different wallet providers to make 1RPC a built-in solution. Stay tuned!
