## Prerequisites

1. You must install Metamask to connect your wallet to the claim page. If you haven't done so, download it from the official [website](https://metamask.io/download).

2. The ATA Tokens are available as both [ERC20](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa2120b9e674d3fc3875f415a7df52e382f141225) and [BEP20](https://bscscan.com/token/0xa2120b9e674d3fc3875f415a7df52e382f141225) tokens.
 
    - To claim ERC20 tokens, simply connect Metamask to the Ethereum Mainnet when prompted.

    - To claim BEP20 tokens, connect Metamask to the BSC Mainnet. If you are new to Metamask, you might need to add a BSC Mainnet configuration to the Metamask settings.

!!! Note
    At this point, Metamask should only be connected to either the Ethereum or BSC Mainnet. The claim page would not work on other network.
