# Introduction
<!-- Replace the landing page url -->
[Automata 2FA](https://atanetwork.editorx.io/my-site-1) is a middleware to protect your assets in different networks and any dApps, designed around fund's secured enhancements in any assets transfer scenarios. Nowadays, user-controlled private key is compromised and excessive or unlimited ERC20 allowance is exploited, which is very dangerous and the assets may be transferred when the attack happens. We introduce a 2FA mechanism as an additional security step before the users make any risky transaction, while authorised transfers in real-time are required, and the secret seed is stored based on the strongest security guarantees.

It's a middleware across different networks and can be served for any dApps which are integrated with our 2FA based smart contract structure. Users can easily setup 2FA for their wallet with their 2FA devices as usual, find 2FA supported dApps and make the authorised transfers on demand.

## Supported Networks:

This middleware is compatible with most EVM networks. We currently support on the following networks:

- BSC

- Polygon

We are working hard to expand the list of supported networks. If you're developers and your target dApp is not included in our supported list, please submit a proposal [here]() or reach out to us at [2fa@ata.network](mailto:2fa@ata.network).

## Supported dApps:

This middleware requires the target dApps are integrated with our 2FA protected contract before the announcement. As a user, you can easily to find what kinds of dApps are supported [here](), setup your 2FA before you use them. As a developer, if you're already integrated with 2FA protected functionality, but you cannot see your dApp shown in [Automata 2FA](), please submit a proposal [here]() or reach out to us at [2fa@ata.network](mailto:2fa@ata.network).

# Ready to start?

As a user, if you're interested in our 2FA protected and want to have a more secured assets, what you need to prepare for 2FA are:

- Primary wallet, the place where you store and control your assets.

- Recovery wallet, it's used for reset the 2FA device if you lost it.

- 2FA device, retrieve your 2FA TOTP code before you make any authorised transfer, please don't use the same device as the primary wallet's.

You can find more details in the [User Guide]().

As a developer, before you release your dApp, you have to integrate them with our 2FA protected smart contract. You can find more details in the [Contract Guide](./contracts/summary.md). Once you're done and deployed it to the target network, reach we out and we will add your dApp in our 2FA management website.

It's highest recommended that setup your 2FA to protect all assets which are supported 2FA, to avoid any potential attack. And it's appreciated to integrate your dApps with our 2FA protection.
