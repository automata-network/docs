## What Happens when Ethereum moves to Proof-of-Stake?
---

The move from PoW to PoS consensus means the Ethereum network becomes secured by a set validators, who stake their ETH and vote on consensus, as opposed to miners who run mining equipment to solve for the proof of work. This change of consensus is set to happen likely some time in 2021. Some have suggested that this means Miner Extractable Value will become Validator Extractable Value.

From Paradigm's piece "On Staking Pools and Staking Derivatives" - Staking pools and their staking derivatives are subject to similar market realities as MEV extraction, in the sense that their existence is inevitable. Institutional staking pools (e.g. exchanges) may have social and reputational constraints that prevent them from extracting certain forms of MEV. This allows smaller staking firms and decentralized pools without these constraints to provide higher returns for their stakers. This could turn the decentralization premium for using a decentralized staking pool into a decentralization discount.
