# Introduction

Automata NFTFair is A NFT launch platform designed around principles of fairness and efficacy for a community-led experience is how we would describe NFTFair. Metadata exploits pre-sniping are all predatory practices that make it unfair for the average user to get their hands on a new collection, much less obtain rare or lucrative items.

# About the fairdrop

## Network:

This platform is compatible with most Layer 1 EVM networks. More specifically, we recommend hosting Fairdrop events on any of the networks below:

- BSC
- Polygon
- Moonriver
- Ethereum

## Fairdrop Templates:

This platform currently supports two templates, i.e. (1) FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and (2) Mystery Boxes Fairdrops.

### FIFO Fairdrop

First-in-first-out vaults enforce the correct ordering of NFT distributions. This is all made possible by [Conveyor](https://www.ata.network/conveyor).

### Mystery Boxes Fairdrop

Mystery boxes are a more restricted form of FIFO Fairdrop. Users who participated in a mystery box fairdrop selects an NFT category, i.e. a collection of token IDs. A single token ID is then randomly chosen and not revealed until the transaction has been broadcasted.

We plan to add more templates in the future.

## Category:

A category defines a collection of NFTs, with a set of configurable properties, such as:

- NFT Contract
- Range of Token IDs
- Sales Price
- Maximum Purchase/Claim Limit

Fairdrop event organizers must define at least one category before sending NFTs to Fairdrop vaults.

## Fairdrop Sales:

This platform provides the option to enable Fairdrop sales, i.e. the trading of NFTs and an acceptable form of ERC20 payment tokens. NFTs can be differentiated by categories, where prices can be set individually.

Each vault only accepts a single ERC20 payment token. In other words, it is not possible to price one category at 100 USDC, and the other at 100 BTC.

You can however, price different categories at different amounts of the same token. For instance, 100 USDC for category A and 1000 USDC for category B.

Sales revenue can be withdrawn via the console.

# Costs

Gas consumption plays a major role on the cost of running Fairdrops. This platform provides a gasless transaction experience, powered by [Conveyor](https://www.ata.network/conveyor). To fully provide the experience of zero-cost transactions to the users, you may opt for relayer-sponsored transactions.

Relayer-sponsored transactions do not charge ERC20 gas payment from the users. The event organizers would bear the full gas cost instead. Please reach out to our team, to get a quote and a cost breakdown for enabling relayer-sponsored transactions.
