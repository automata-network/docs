# Introduction

Automata NFTFair is A NFT launch platform designed around principles of fairness and efficacy for a community-led experience is how we would describe NFTFair. Metadata exploits pre-sniping are all predatory practices that make it unfair for the average user to get their hands on a new collection, much less obtain rare or lucrative items.

We want to make every NFT journey begins with fairness — clearly a non-negotiable attribute. More than just kicking off a positive feedback loop between trust and adoption in the metaverse, it’s imperative for any NFT launch that seeks to do right by its community.

# About the fairdrop?

## Network:

You can launch a fairdrop in most of the EVM-compatible networks. Such as ETH, BSC, Polygon, Moonriver, except for the layer 2 network. We don't support the layer 2 network for now. Due to the expensive transaction gas fee in the ETH network, we recommend you launch your fairdrop in BSC.

## Fairdrops types:

We have two types of fairdrops by now: 1. Blind box fairdrop, 2. First come, first serve fairdrop. The users will get one random NFT per purchase in the blind box fairdrop. On the other hand, the users can pick whatever they wish in the FCFS fairdrop in those available NFTs.

## Category:

In both types of fairdrops, you can set several categories for your NFTs. Each category represents a bundle of NFTs. It has its price and max purchase limit.

## Payment:

If you determine to turn on the payment option for your fairdrop, you can choose a token to be your payment token. Then the users need to pay the price set in the category settings to purchase an NFT, and you can withdraw your sales income from our console later.

# About your costs?

We will charge fees for each of your fairdrops. You can contact our sales for the price. Furthermore, for a better user experience, we don't recommend you to charge your user for transaction gas fee. Therefore, our [Conveyor](https://www.ata.network/conveyor) service will do gasless transactions for the users, and we will settle the gas fee with you after the fairdrop.
