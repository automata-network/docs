# Automata Network

Welcome to Automata Networkâ€™s Documentation! Automata Network is the privacy middleware layer building to protect fairness & privacy in Web3. Its core suite of products include:

* [1RPC](https://www.1rpc.io)
* [NFTFair](https://nftfair.app)
* [2FA Guru](https://2fa.guru)
* [Carrier](https://carrier.so)


Some of our key features:
- No tracking privacy
- Native integration supporting multichain integration
- Universal compatibility

Our [Medium](https://medium.com/atanetwork) is a great introduction to our vision and work. 

**Overview**

Given the default transparency of blockchain, users struggle with moving large amount of their fortunes into what is invariably an exposed glass box. The developer experience is a central part of Automata's design and helps to explain our middleware approach. For blockchain projects to advocate for and adopt privacy at the protocol level, it's important to us to reduce integration friction and make the experience a positive one for builders, and further down the line, end-users. 

Some of our middleware solutions include [Conveyor](https://conveyor.ata.network/#/swap), a MEV Minimization solution, and Witness, for off-chain privacy governance. 

The best way to understand how we're doing this is to dive into our technical framework. Here's an ELI5 [version.](https://medium.com/atanetwork/introduction-to-sgx-the-eli5-3abf25e50057)
